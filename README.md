## Development of a PDF-Based Question-Answering Chatbot Using LangChain
### AIM:
To design and implement a question-answering chatbot capable of processing and extracting information from a provided PDF document using LangChain, and to evaluate its effectiveness by testing its responses to diverse queries derived from the document's content.

### PROBLEM STATEMENT:
The objective is to create a chatbot that can intelligently respond to queries based on information extracted from a PDF document. By using LangChain, the chatbot will be able to process the content of the PDF and use a language model to provide relevant answers to user queries. The effectiveness of the chatbot will be evaluated by testing it with various questions related to the document.

### DESIGN STEPS:

#### STEP 1:
Use a library like PyPDFLoader to load the PDF document. Split the content into smaller text chunks using a TextSplitter (e.g., RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter) for efficient information retrieval.

#### STEP 2:
Convert the text chunks into numerical embeddings using OpenAIEmbeddings and store them in a vector database (e.g., Chroma) to enable similarity-based search.

#### STEP 3:
Use the vector database's retriever to fetch relevant text chunks based on user queries. Set the retriever parameters (e.g., search type) for accurate results.

### STEP 4:
Use an OpenAI language model (e.g., GPT-4 or GPT-3.5) and a retrieval chain like RetrievalQA or ConversationalRetrievalChain to combine document context with conversational responses.

### STEP 5:
Create a conversational interface (e.g., a command-line or GUI-based system) where users can input queries, and the chatbot responds with context-aware answers based on the PDF.

### RESULT:

The PDF-based Question-Answering Chatbot was successfully developed using LangChain and OpenAIâ€™s GPT model.
It was able to load the PDF, extract its content, and accurately answer user queries based on the document information.
The chatbot provided clear and relevant responses for different types of questions, demonstrating its ability to retrieve and understand context from the PDF.
Hence, the experiment was successfully completed, and the chatbot worked as expected.
